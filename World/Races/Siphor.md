The Siphor are a mysterious race of bizarre entities made out of a colony of living creatures working together in tandem. Little is known about their origins, since they don't like to share. 
Siphor have a humanoid gelatinous body that possesses surprising strength despite their lack of muscles. However, because of their lack of bones, they can move their bodies in ways that the other races can't, making very agile and unusual movements that would be impossible for a human to achieve. Siphor can also exchange body parts with each other, and make new body parts if damaged. While they have two sexes, it is unknown how exactly they multiply. The being that is in control of the Siphor is the one that makes up the 'head', and while it cannot live for an extended period of time without its body, Siphors have been known to transplant heads to different bodies in order to save the lives of some members of their race. Siphor are strangely tolerant to most toxic and corrosive substances, making it very rare for them to be sick or poisoned. They can also swim and breathe underwater, but both humans and Orcon agree that the undulating movements they use to swim are unsettling, though effective. 
Siphor are mysterious and don't like to talk about themselves to people of other races. They live on many islands on the border of the Red Desert, the region choked by the Red Tide. It is unknown how many Siphor exist outside of the islands, as many of them prefer to avoid civilisation altogether and spend their time drifting in the vast ocean in small communities, going wherever the tides take them. Siphor are rarely seen in larger civilised islands, but many of them often end up settling briefly in smaller islands communities.
