The Kitsune are a rare race that comes from an archipelago in the Eastern sea. Due to the currents of the Eastern sea, they have been for a long time isolated from the other races and have only recently entered the world stage. 
Kitsune are humanoid, but possess varying vulpine features in a variety of colours. However, all of them have a vulpine tail, which is said to be the source of their magic. While not as physically powerful as most of the other races, Kitsune possess powerful magical ability and are excellent at adapting to unfamiliar situations. Kitsune also have a powerful bond with a particular divine beast – the First Phoenix, which nests on the largest of the islands in their home archipelago. Though not all Kitsune venerate this beast, their affinity to it gives them an advantage in the magical arts.
Kitsune are known for their curiosity and magical talent, making them very popular among wizard schools and cleric clubs. While many are unfamiliar with them, their natural charisma and adaptability makes them a good fit for many crews looking to sail the seas. However, while Kitsune can easily get along with others, they rarely form deep or long-lasting relationships with people who are not of the same race.
