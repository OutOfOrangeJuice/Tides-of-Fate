Partial Deep-Born are the offspring of a Deep-Born and a human. They are comparatively rare since Deep-Born and humans rarely get together, but their mixed heritage gives them an unusual resistance to mental afflictions and curses. 
Partial Deep-Born had human hair and less bulging eyes. However, they still possess a few fishlike facial features which are visible up close. They also have partially webbed hands and feet, but they too inherit the clumsy swimming abilities of the Deep-Born. They cannot breathe underwater, but have vestigial gills which they can use to breathe when their mouth and nose are covered.  
Partial Deep-Born are generally regarded poorly by humans and Deep-Born, who see them as unnatural. This, combined with the fact that human-Deep-Born relationships are heavily looked down upon by both races means that they often have a rough childhood and find themselves in lower positions on smuggling boats or crime organisations. However, the Partial Deep-Born that avoid this fate often find Cleric Clubs or Orcon communities in which they are accepted and can make use of their talents.
