The Orcon are an ancient race of people who come from a small smattering of islands in the central sea. Little is known about their origins due to their penchant to exaggerate wildly when recording information, but it is common knowledge that they have some connection to the Matriarch Leviathan. 
Orcon are a large and physically imposing race, bearing sleek features with a human-like face that protrudes a bit and unsettling black eyes. They are very agile both on land and in the water, and are naturally gifted swimmers and underwater fighters. The Orcon cannot breathe underwater, but the average Orcon can hold their breath for up to 20 minutes while submerged, with some members of the race being capable of much more. 
Orcon have a strength-oriented culture, with few of them choosing to learn magic. They tend to be very insular, but will enthusiastically accept outsiders who prove their strength in one way or another, while also boasting about their own strength to anyone who will listen. Many Orcon can be found working as haulers or as guards for ships, due to their capabilities in the water.
