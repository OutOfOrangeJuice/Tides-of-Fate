The Deep-Born are an ancient race of people said to be descended from a human cult that worshipped the Fathom-Father, and became hybridised with the divine beast's offspring through a spell that destroyed most of their organisation. 
The Deep-Born possess many human features, however, they have bulging fishlike eyes, partially webbed hands and feet, and grow tentacle-like appendages in place of hair, which they cannot control. They also possess gills, allowing them to breathe underwater. However, compared to other swimming races like the Siphors and Orcons, the Deep-Born are not clumsy and move with little agility in the water. 
Deep-Born have become known for a lack of morals and general untrustworthiness due to their heritage. The Fathom-Father's dreams are said to touch their minds, corrupting Deep-Born from a young age and dampening their sense of empathy for other creatures while enhancing their innate selfishness. It is not known whether this is true, but the demographics do indicate them committing more crimes according to humans. On a related note, humans find Deep-Born unsettling and repulsive to be around.
