mmmmmm dragons

Dragons have big wings that are significantly larger than the entire rest of their body. They also have a mouth that opens four ways and five tongues. Four tongues are rough, sharp, and prehensile. The last one is a tube. 

Dragons come from the moon. They fly through space using magic and prey on islands by drilling through the tough shells using their sharp tongues and sucking out all the blood and inside bits with their other tongue. There is a dragon season every year where everyone on an island has to be on guard for dragons.

Dragons are the biggest threat to people living on islands because they kill a lot of islands. Also their blood is toxic because lol.

Also they have breath weapons but I'll work on those later. Along with the rest of the lore and the stat block.
