The only landmasses are the islands – floating creatures which grow to colossal sizes. Entire ecosystems form on their shells.

Islands wander the seas, both in groups (archipelagos) and as individuals. Once full grown, their sheer size protects them from all but the largest predators (basically just Krakens, Dragons, and The WORLD SERPENT).

They don't die of old age and instead just keep getting bigger. Islands have shells made of rock, which transformed into an ecosystem over time as it grows and various plants, fungi, seabirds, etc. make the island their home. I'll write more later about life cycle, feeding, breeding, stat block maybe...
