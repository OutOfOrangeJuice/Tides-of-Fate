#### Notable Value Orders
Joker: 1
Jack: 11
Queen: 12
King: 13
Ace: 14

Except for stat selection which has different rules (blackjack). If a joker is drawn, belay all additional draws. 


Play with two piles: Active pile and discard pile. Cards are set into the discard pile after being drawn. When shuffling occurs, mix the two piles (if there are two piles) and shuffle as normal.

Shuffling happens when
- The active pile is empty
- After resting
- Player(s) level up
- Between sessions
- At the dm's discretion (important scene transitions, moments before fights, turning points, etc.)


Instead of advantage, give *foresight*. 

Foresight reveals the top card of the active pile before a player draws. 
The player can opt to draw the card, or discard the card and draw the one underneath without looking at it (may look at it if multiple stacks of foresight are accrued, then draw or discard, etc.). 
If the foresight card is the last active card and it is discarded, shuffle the discard pile into a new active pile and draw the top card.

Instead of disadvantage, give *unpreparedness*.

When a draw is unprepared, draw the top two cards and subtract the lower card from the higher card for the value. Do not draw bonus cards when unprepared. Foresight and unpreparedness cancel each other out. If there is only one card in the active pile, shuffle the discard pile and put it underneath the active card before drawing.
