The Combatant class is the primary combat focused martial class, with less out-of-combat abilities compared classes like Privateer and Spy. 

Combatants have stances which change their role in the battle both passively and through active abilities which can be unlocked as the Combatant levels up. The stances this class can unlock depends on the subclass that is chosen.
