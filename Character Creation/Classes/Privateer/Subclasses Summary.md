#### Cannoneer
This subclass of Privateer focuses on operating large weapon emplacements. While cumbersome, the power of these weapons is unrivalled in low level encounters. As such, this subclass focuses on making the cannons more versatile and easy to use rather than increasing damage output.

#### Navigator
The Navigator is the least combat-oriented subclass of Privateer, with a focus on knowledge and support. Navigators are specialised in navigating the tides and currents of the ocean, avoiding the territories of predators, and tracking down specific islands. This subclass also gets access to some ship piloting abilities similar to the captain.

#### Swashbuckler
Swashbuckler is the more combat-focused subclass of Privateer, with less of a focus on ship operation and more of a focus on fighting. Swashbuckler would be a very simple and stable subclass to play, with abilities that help both in combat and out of combat.

#### Captain
This is the leadership subclass, with abilities that involve aura buffs and debuffs, as well as ship-piloting abilities. Captain also gets an animal companion because roleplay (parrot). Overall a support subclass that has more of an effect the more crew there are to buff.

#### Rigger
Rigger is a unique subclass with a focus on mobility. This subclass grants things like a climbing speed, unpreparedness for enemies using opportunity attacks, and a unique swing movement option which relies on being on a rope of some kind (synergy with puppeteer – being puppeted counts for this movement option, allowing for sick combo attacks). Rigger also gets abilities for ship repair and maintenance. 

#### Lookout
This subclass is focused on perception and combat support, similar to the ranger combatant subclass. The Lookout gets abilities related to perception range, perceptive capability, combat marks, and ranged attacks.
