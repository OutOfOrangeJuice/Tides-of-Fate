#### Master of Strings
This subclass doubles down into the base class abilities, allowing you to puppet more enemies and allies as well as do more to disrupt or enhance their abilities.

#### Puppet Fighter
This subclass grants a construct which the puppeteer can control to fight alongside him. The construct can specialise in a variety of martial archetypes.

#### Puppet Enchanter
A spellcasting version of the Puppet Fighter. The Puppet Enchanter's construct can cast spells, but is not as durable or martially inclined. The spells it can cast are limited, but it has a lot of spell slots for a partial spellcaster subclass which makes it very powerful.

#### Doll Summoner
The Doll Summoner specialises in creating large numbers of weaker constructs to control and summoning them magically onto the battlefield to take advantage of vulnerabilities. Dolls can have various abilities, but the abilities are limited and the dolls are temporary.

#### Adaptive Controller
This subclass focuses on the ability to control allies, allowing you to take much more complex actions with them and puppet them with their own skill levels and proficiencies. While not impressive on its own, this subclass greatly amplifies the abilities of already powerful allies.

#### Shadow Manipulator
This subclass focuses more on the sinister aspects of the class, giving abilities that allow you to do more evil things to your puppeted enemies. Shadow manipulator has a focus on causing chaos in enemy ranks, so it's better if your dm is willing to rp in combat.
