The Puppeteer class is a punch focused ranged support martial class – a niche which does not exist in dnd lol. This class can puppet both allies and enemies for focused control effects and action economy. Some subclasses of puppeteer can also control a specialised puppet construct kind of like an animal companion to fight on the front lines.

Puppeteers can apply the entangled support effect, which allows them to make additional actions with allies and restrain enemies. The idea behind this class is that you can restrain enemy actions in combat, with more of a focus on dangerous individuals than large groups. Also the idea behind this class was the puppet archetype in fighting games. The idea of puppetting people and enemies comes from Mario in MBTL. Also it'd be cool for this class to have a cross brace as a unique class weapon. Note: I just watched mashle and dang that one dude with the puppets is almost exactly my idea for this class minus the turning people into puppets thing. Pretty cool.
