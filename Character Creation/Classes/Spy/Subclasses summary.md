#### Phantom
Phantom is the sneaky sleight of hand class with a focus on remaining unseen, stealing stuff, and breaking into things. This subclass gets stealth bonuses, trap detection, stealing, lockpicking, etc. 

#### Assassin
A straightforward combat focused subclass. Assassin focuses on maximising sneak damage and piercing damage resistances, but also movement and disguises.

#### Infiltrator
Infiltrator is all about acting and hiding in plain sight, with a focus on disguises, diplomacy, and deception. More support oriented than combat oriented but gets some neat knowledge based bonuses in a fight.

#### Reaver
The least sneaky of the spy subclasses. The reaver centres around a barrier mechanic that allows it to essentially act as a party's tank. Also more combat focused, similar to the assassin, but it can facetank through a lot of damage effects and tough environments too.

#### Bounty Hunter
Bounty Hunter is a more mercantile spy variant with a focus on traps and some abilities that it shares with the ranger. Generally more useful with setup, and not that helpful out of combat.

#### Adept
Adept is the more monk-adjacent subclass, with various combat maneuvers that allow it to activate and take advantage of control effects. More skilled than the average spy.
