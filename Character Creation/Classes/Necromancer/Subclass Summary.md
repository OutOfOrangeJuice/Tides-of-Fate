#### Dark Sorcerer
Focused more on spellcasting than other subclasses. More of a sorcerer with necromancer abilities really. Weakest in terms of minions but that also gives it the most use in situations where zombies aren't readily available. Good for vampires also if you want to make vampires but I'm not making vampires like a minion mechanic I just think this would be the best subclass for a vampire.

#### Lich Ascendant
For players who want to be a lich. Lich ascendant allows the character to become an undead. It also casts wizard spells, but with less spell slots than wizards of the same level. Add minions and this class can be really strong – spellcaster with a living wall of zombies to defend him. You also get self-enhancing abilities from being a lich. 

#### Lord of the Horde
Simplest necromancer subclass with a focus on capacity and puppeting. Lets you get lots of minions and unlocks hordes and behemoths earlier. Pretty basic but very strong if there are a lot of combat encounters to get bodies from. You can also put the capacity into making stronger composite zombies but there's a better subclass for that.

#### Spirit Binder
Opposite of the Lord of the Horde – focuses on reanimating classed opponents at near or at their full strength by enslaving their spirits and binding them to their undead bodies. Allows the player to access extremely powerful minions if the dm provides formidable enemies to enslave. Also not very good at low levels. Other subclasses can also do the same thing, so it only provides value if the enemies are often at or above the player level and the player wants to do some chicanery. 

#### Bone Architect
Allows for skeletons instead of zombies as minions. Skeletons aren't reliant on the strength of the dead enemies so this class is good if your dm doesn't provide a lot of material for you to reanimate. Skeletons will be less flexible than zombies, but you'll have more control over how they're built. Because you lose access to zombies, this class is a very different experience compared to all the others.

#### Unliving Artificer
Subclass dedicated to composite zombies (stitching parts from multiple bodies together) and also attaching equipment and gadgets to zombies for maximum lethality. Great if the dm gives a large variety of different parts and equipment to play with, as you can create some wacky crazy monstrosities that are very powerful in combat.
