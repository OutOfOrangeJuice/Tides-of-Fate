Sorcery is used by sorcerers, oracles, and clerics. With sorcery, you can apply spells and effects to various different cards upon resting, and draw a deck as an action. This makes the spells you can cast at any point somewhat random, but potentially more than the wizard. You can also apply modifiers as well as spells to the deck, allowing you to modify the spells (essentially metamagic).
